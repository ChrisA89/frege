{--
 
    This package provides the 'Monad' class and related classes and functions.
    
    This package is /implementation specific/ insofar as the compiler may
    assume that certain items are defined here in a certain way.
    Changes may thus lead to compiler crashes or java code that 
    will be rejected by the java compiler.
    
    In particular, desugared *do* expressions will reference 'Monad', '>>=' and '>>'.
    
    This package is implicitly imported.
