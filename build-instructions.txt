Some notes for those who are building the compiler from scratch.

When on MacOS, make sure you get a suitable yacc installation.
You may want to look at http://byaccj.sourceforge.net.
The one in XCode is not sufficient.

Set the YACC variable in Makefile to the yacc binary.

For rebuilding from scratch make sure you have deleted the old grammar file if there is one:

rm frege/compiler/Grammar.fr

Make sure you have the rights to create folders and files.

Set Java to a Java 7 SDK.

The make is a two-step process. It first creates a frege.mk file.
That file is then used start the actual make process.

# build command:
make frege.mk && make -f frege.mk runtime 'shadow-prelude' compiler

This takes a few minutes.

You can now make the fregec.jar. This process includes a self-test.
The Frege compiler is written in Frege itself and we use the compiler
as a non-trivial Frege program that validates that the compiler is
working.

sudo make -f frege.mk fregec.jar
