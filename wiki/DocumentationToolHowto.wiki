#summary Tool to generate module documentation
#labels Phase-Deploy

Say you have compiled a module foo.bar.Baz and you want to generate the documentation. 

{{{
java -cp frege.jar frege.tools.Doc -d doc -fp . foo.bar.Baz
}}}

This will create a file `doc/foo/bar/Baz.html` with useful information derived from the class file. Make sure to specify the correct class path with -fp. Among others, documentation from the source code doc comments will be included.

The directory `doc` must exist previously, other directories are created on the fly.

The generated document may contain hyperlinks to documentation of modules your module depends on.They will work under the assumption that all documentation was generated with the same target directory (-d).
