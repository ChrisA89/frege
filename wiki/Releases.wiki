===Compatibility===

In the table above the level of backward compatibility relative to the previous release is given.

The levels are (in decreasing severity):

  * *lang* Language level changes may result in compiler errors on source code that compiled fine on the previous version. 
  * *source* Changes in libraries, all code that uses this library must be recompiled. *source all* means all source code must be recompiled due to changes in the base library or runtime system.
  * *binary* Changes are binary compatible and only add new functionality (such as a new library)
  * *usability* backward compatibility is not affected


If one ignores backward compatibility issues, running code compiled with previous versions may lead to crashes with ClassNotFound or MethodNotFound or other mysterious exceptions. In such cases, remove *all* Frege generated class files and re-compile your sources.
