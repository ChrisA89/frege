===Compatibility===

In the table above the level of backwards compatibility relative to the previous release is given.

The levels are in decreasing severity:

  * *lang* Language level changes may result in compiler errors on source code that compiled fine on the previous version. 
  * *source* Changes in libraries, all code that uses this library must be recompiled. *source all* means all source code must be recompiled due to changes in the base library or runtime system.
  * *binary* Changes are binary compatible and only add new functionality (such as a new library)
  * *usability* backwards compatibility is not affected


If one ignores backwards compatibility issues, running code compiled with previous versions may lead to ClassNotFound/MethodNotFound or other mysterious exceptions thrown on runtime. In such cases, remove all Frege generated class files and re-compile your sources.
