#summary How to install and use the Eclipse Frege plugin.
#labels Phase-Deploy,Deprecated

= Introduction =

The Eclipse plugin that supports Frege is called *fregIDE*. Don't ask how to pronounce that!

The fregIDE is may be usable, but in a very early stage of development. Currently, the following is supported:

  * Enabling a project to use the Frege Builder.
  * Frege preferences
  * Syntax coloring
  * Instant error markers in the editor
  * Project build, i.e. compilation of Frege files
  * Compilation populates the problem view with errors, warnings and hints.

= Installation =

  * Download the latest version of `fregIDE3.`_xx_._vvv_`.zip` labelled _Featured_ from the download page.
  * Start up Eclipse.
  * Open the preferences page `Window` -> `Preferences`, and go to the `Install/Update` section. Open the `Available SOftware Sites` page and `Add...` the *IMP Update Site* with Location  `http://download.eclipse.org/technology/imp/updates/`. Close the preferences page.
  * Open the installation page `Help` -> `Install New Software`
  * Click `Add...` and enter a name, for example `fregIDE archive`. Then click `Archive...` and locate the 

= Known Issues =

Not yet implemented, but planned:

  * outline view
  * mouse over feedback, such as displaying the type or documentation for an item
  * code completion and other content proposals
  * QuickCheck support
  * Interpreter ("scrapbook")

Not implemented, unsure whether we need that:

  * text folding
  * hyperlinking
  * reference resolution
  * text formatting


Usage issues:

  * enormous amounts of memory required
  * when memory gets full, IDE becomes unresponsive up to the point where one better kills Eclipse
  * because every builder and file parser loads its own compiler classes (due to the OSGI architecture of eclipse?), enormous amounts of PermGen space are needed.
