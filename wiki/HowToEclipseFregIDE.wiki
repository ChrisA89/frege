#summary How to install and use the Eclipse Frege plugin.
#labels Phase-Deploy,Deprecated

= Introduction =

The Eclipse plugin that supports Frege is called *fregIDE*. Don't ask how to pronounce that!

The fregIDE is hopefully already usable, but in a very early stage of development. Currently, the following is supported:

  * Enabling a project to use the Frege Builder.
  * Frege preferences
  * Syntax coloring
  * Live error markers in the editor
  * Project build, i.e. compilation of Frege files
  * Compilation populates the problem view with errors, warnings and hints and the editor with persistent markers.

= Prerequisites =

   * JRE 1.7 (no JDK required)
   * Eclipse 3.7

(I see the possibility that one could get that running with a 
lower JRE and Eclipse version, for example Eclipse 3.5 with JRE 1.6.
If you are bound to an environment that does not match the above and want to give it a try, contact me.)

= Preparation =

Eclipse should have the following VM settings: 

`-Xmx512m -Xss1m -XX:MaxPermSize=128M`

For more information see [http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_increase_the_permgen_size_available_to_Eclipse? the Eclipse FAQ]

The figure `-Xss` is to be understood as minimal values. For source files with hundreds of lines you better double it.

= Installation =

  * Download the latest version of `fregIDE3.`_xx_._vvv_`.zip` labelled _Featured_ from the download page.
  * Start up Eclipse.
  * Open the preferences page `Window` -> `Preferences`, and go to the `Install/Update` section. Open the `Available Software Sites` page and `Add...` the *IMP Update Site* with Location  `http://download.eclipse.org/technology/imp/updates/`. Close the preferences page. (This must be done upon first install of fregIDE only.)
  * Open the installation page `Help` -> `Install New Software`
  * Click `Add...` and enter a name, for example *fregIDE archive*. Then click `Archive...` and locate the downloaded zip file.
  * Turn off the check box `Group items by category`
  * Turn on the check box `Contact all update sites during installation to find required software`
  * In the list box select the feature `Functional Programming with Frege`
  * Click `Next>` to start the installation and confirm a few dialogs, license agreements and warnings because of unsigned content to complete it.
  * When asked, restart Eclipse to activate the installed plugins.

= Usage =

  * First create a java project.
  * Review the `Preferences` -> `Frege` page. Choose colors and fonts and make sure the path to the frege library is set.
  * From the context menu of the project, select `Enable Frege Builder`.
  * Create a source file with extension `.fr` and begin editing.
  * Enjoy.

= Known Issues =

Not yet implemented, but planned:

  * outline view
  * mouse over feedback, such as displaying the type or documentation for an item
  * code completion and other content proposals
  * QuickCheck support
  * Interpreter ("scrapbook")

Not implemented, unsure whether we need that:

  * text folding
  * hyperlinking
  * reference resolution
  * text formatting


Usage issues:

  * because every builder and editor loads its own compiler classes (due to the OSGI architecture of eclipse?), unusual amounts of PermGen space are needed.
